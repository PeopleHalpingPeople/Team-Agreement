# Team-Agreement

## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

- Key Strengths Of Our Team:
  - *Nicki*: Front end design, asking about why certain aspects of code work and how they interact.
  - *Jessi*: Team management and assigning roles appropriately, discussing the actual complexity of the code. An end goal for how the overall project will turn out and will push to ensure the goal is met.
  - *Simone*: Ensuring goals are met and we accomplish those goals within that time frame, working in the tranches to ensure the task is complete for the day. Strong skills with googling to find solution, and throwing in console logs to find a right path.
  - *Jason*: My strengths lie in documentation for the scope of the project, being able to look at the project as whole and making sure that not only code works but it can be presented. Being able to make the difficult call about when to call it enough on part of the application that is meeting requirements.

- How can we best utilize these strengths in the execution of our project?
  - We have a lot of interpersonal and soft skills in this group, on the technicality side of things Jessi can explain how the code is working. Nicki is always willing to ask questions about the code and that gives our group the opportunity to review what we are working on. 

- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - We want to focus more on the execution of the code and being able to take the thought driven process and apply that to the code. 

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
  - Our approach is to do MOB programming so we all understand what the focus of the code is, and if we feel it is necessary we can pair program.

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  - Communicating what is taking place and always asking questions as things arise.
  - Talk about the issues as they arise and doing the best part to resolve the problems
  - Using a democratic process and go with majority vote, we don't anticipate having any issues.
  - If we get to a point where we cannot take care of the issue we can involve Brian.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
  - As mentioned before we will work on the communicating and ensure that we are clear about how we are feeling as a group.

- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Being open and honest about where we are at within the process, using the MOB process as a way to walk through the process. No person left behind!!!! We are in this together and we want to learn about the fundamentals of the code and how to implement the project.

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - Making sure we are all present and contributing to the project. We can also have the individual drive as an opportunity to feel like they are contributing.

- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  - After talking individuals we bring it up to Brian as a last stretch.
  - Recognizing that we need to bring up things right away because there is limited time to address the issues. 

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  - Jason: Free 8am to 10pm
  - Jessi: Flexible schedule, prefer to end by 10pm
  - Nicki: Stronger in the mornings, not as effective in the afternoon
  - Simone: Saturdays are a no go, Tuesday nights and Thursday night no later than 9 pm.

  - Group: Start time 9am to 6pm and extend as needed, 1 hour lunch from 12pm to 1pm.

- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  - Slack, or on Remo, will use personal phones as needed

- How often will you take breaks?
  - Taking ten minute breaks every hour, possibly do the Pomodoro Method
  - Focused 25 min, 5 min break
  - Do four of those in a row and then take a long 30 min break.

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Extending our time from 9am to 6pm as needed extend to 10pm, if we have an issue either call a TA, or involve Brian.
  - Use the 20-25min rule for any problems

- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  - Slack, personal phones as needed

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  - Considering everyone's request, listening to any concerns as they arise.

- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  - We are not afraid to communicate how we are feeling and also being aware of how the group is feeling.

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

Describe at least:

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  - We will use Github projects to keep track of tasks. Ensuring we keep up to date with our pull requests, and switching up roles for other people to drive for a chance.
- What project management tool will be used?
  - Github projects is our main tool

## Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  
  - All of our files, commits, links to websites, etc.
  - (Possibly use AWS SNS)
  - Ask Brian for advice or Chance

- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  - It's contained in our organization so we all have access to the files.

- What is your Git flow?
  - We will set up the repo so that two people will review a pull request from the dev branch before it is merged into the main branch.
  - Main, Dev, Jessi, Simone, Nicki, Jason

- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  - Yes we be implementing a review process to ensure we do not delete important bits of code.

- How many people must review a PR?
  - Two people will

- Who merges PRs?
  - Whomever did not do the main driving and or whomever is available

- How often will you merge?
  - At the end of a feature task we will discuss if we are ready to do a merge

- How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
  - Either slack the team or we likely will be in Remo
